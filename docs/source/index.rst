JupyterHub on Hadoop
====================

JupyterHub_ provides a secure, multi-user interactive notebook_ environment. It
allows users to access a shared computing environment conveniently through a
webpage, with no local installation required.

JupyterHub is flexible and can be deployed in many different environments. In
the spirit of Zero-to-JupyterHub-Kubernetes_, this guide aims to help you set
up your own JupyterHub on an existing `Hadoop Cluster`_.

Note that this guide is under active development. If you find things unclear or
incorrect, or have any questions/comments, feel free to `create an issue on
